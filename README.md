# Les Recettes d'Audrey
---- Version 0.1 - July 12th 2024 ----\
My first website for The Odin Project.\
I'm learning about basic HTML for now, CSS and JS are not yet implemented. Looking forward to that tho!\
It's fun to use Git for the first time as well. I'm almost ashamed to have used Github as some sort of textfiles hosting service up until now with lots of dragging and dropping of files.\
\
---- Version 0.2 - July 16th 2024 ----\
Created a new repo to not have the site on my The Odin Project exercise repo.\
Added basic CSS and Audrey actually liked the idea of the site, so I guess we'll add lots of recipes in the future!\
