# Les Recettes d'Audrey
---- Version 0.3 - October 22nd 2024 ----\
Picked the project up again after having frustrating issues with the site structure.\
Added JS to basically make a single page application, most of the HTML is now actually done in the js.\
The CSS has been expanded and we added a date-based css switcher.\
The menu has been completely revamped as well.\
I've been using a lot of tutorials to find out about newer techniques.\
\
---- Version 0.2 - July 16th 2024 ----\
Created a new repo to not have the site on my The Odin Project exercise repo.\
Added basic CSS and Audrey actually liked the idea of the site, so I guess we'll add lots of recipes in the future!\
\
---- Version 0.1 - July 12th 2024 ----\
My first website for The Odin Project.\
I'm learning about basic HTML for now, CSS and JS are not yet implemented. Looking forward to that tho!\
It's fun to use Git for the first time as well. I'm almost ashamed to have used Github as some sort of textfiles hosting service up until now with lots of dragging and dropping of files.\
